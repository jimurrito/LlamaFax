# LlamaFax (In Development)
<h2>AI generated Llama "facts"</h2>

**DESCRIPTION IS OUT-OF-DATE**

<ul>
<li>Statments will be pulled from the internet, and saved into a Database.</li>
<li>These "Raw" statments are tokenized, and analized by a NLN framwork. This output withh show what type of words are present, and what they mean.</li>
<li>Raw data, and analysis data will be pulled from the database, and pushed into a NLN designed to replace certain words with llama related words.</li>
<li>Statments generated will likely be 100% false, but hopfully some decent precentage of humor :).</li>
<li>Once a statement is generated, it will be sent though an analysis to see if the sentence makes grammatical sense.</li>
<li>If the statment passes vetting, it will be saved as a successful generation (RTS).</li>
<li>Failed renders will be saved as corpus data.</li>
</ul>
